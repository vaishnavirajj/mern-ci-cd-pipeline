# Step 01

**Description:** Initialize the project by setting up a minimal React front‑end using Vite.  This step lays the foundation for the user interface of the MERN application.  It displays a simple welcome message and does not yet interact with any back‑end or API.

**Changes in this step**

- Created a `front-end` directory with a basic Vite/React setup.
- Added `package.json` with React and Vite dependencies.
- Added `index.html` and `vite.config.js` for Vite configuration.
- Added `src/App.jsx` and `src/main.jsx` to render a welcome page.

After this step, you can run the front‑end locally using `npm install` and `npm run dev` inside the `front-end` directory.
